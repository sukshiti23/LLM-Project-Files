To explain in what has consisted the revenue of the great body
of the people, or what has been the nature of those funds, which,
in different ages and nations, have supplied their annual consumption, is the object of these four first books. The fifth and last book
treats of the revenue of the sovereign, or commonwealth. In this
book I have endeavoured to shew, first, what are the necessary
expenses of the sovereign, or commonwealth; which of those ex-

menâs talents he has occasion for,
AS IT IS THE POWER of exchanging that gives occasion to the division of labour, so the extent of this division must always be limited by the extent of that power, or, in other words, by the extent
of the market. When the market is very small, no person can have
any encouragement to dedicate himself entirely to one employment, for want of the power to exchange all that surplus part of
the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own
consumption, for such parts of the produce of other menâs labour
as he has occasion for.
There are some sorts of industry, even of the lowest kind, which
can be carried on nowhere but in a great town. A porter, for example, can find employment and subsistence in no other place. A
village is by much too narrow a sphere for him; even an ordinary
market-town is scarce large enough to afford him constant occupation. In the lone houses and very small villages which are scattered about in so desert a country as the highlands of Scotland,
every farmer must be butcher, baker, and brewer, for his own family. In such situations we can scarce expect to find even a smith, a

of them by exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his own
labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such
parts of the produce of other menâs labour as he has occasion for.
Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes, in some measure, a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society.
But when the division of labour first began to take place, this
power of exchanging must frequently have been very much clogged
and embarrassed in its operations. One man, we shall suppose,
has more of a certain commodity than he himself has occasion for,
while another has less. The former, consequently, would be glad
to dispose of; and the latter to purchase, a part of this superfluity.
But if this latter should chance to have nothing that the former
stands in need of, no exchange can be made between them. The
butcher has more meat in his shop than he himself can consume,
and the brewer and the baker would each of them be willing to

sive corporation, it may, perhaps, be proper to regulate the price
of the first necessary of life; but, where there is none, the competition will regulate it much better than any assize. The method of
fixing the assize of bread, established by the 31st of George II.
could not be put in practice in Scotland, on account of a defect in
the law, its execution depending upon the office of clerk of the
market, which does not exist there. This defect was not remedied
till the third of George III. The want of an assize occasioned no
sensible inconveniency; and the establishment of one in the few
places where it has yet taken place has produced no sensible advantage. In the greater part of the towns in Scotland, however,
there is an incorporation of bakers, who claim exclusive privileges,
though they are not very strictly guarded. The proportion between
the different rates, both of wages and profit, in the different employments of labour and stock, seems not to be much affected, as
has already been observed, by the riches or poverty, the advancing,
stationary, or declining state of the society. Such revolutions in the

Conclusion of the Chapter.

I shall conclude this very long chapter with observing, that every
improvement in the circumstances of the society tends, either di-

indirectly to raise the real rent of land. The landlord exchanges
that part of his rude produce, which is over and above his own

rectly or indirectly, to raise the real rent of land to increase the real
wealth of the landlord, his power of purchasing the labour, or the

consumption, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of that
part of it, for manufactured produce. Whatever reduces the real

I

N THAT RUDE STATE OF SOCIETY, in which there is no division

of labour, in which exchanges are seldom made, and in which

every man provides every thing for himself, it is not necessary that any stock should be accumulated, or stored up beforehand, in order to carry on the business of the society. Every man
endeavours to supply, by his own industry, his own occasional
wants, as they occur. When he is hungry, he goes to the forest to
hunt; when his coat is worn out, he clothes himself with the skin
of the first large animal he kills: and when his hut begins to go to
ruin, he repairs it, as well as he can, with the trees and the turf that
are nearest it.
But when the division of labour has once been thoroughly introduced, the produce of a manâs own labour can supply but a
very small part of his occasional wants. The far greater part of
them are supplied by the produce of other menâs labour, which he
purchases with the produce, or, what is the same thing, with the

him, and to supply him with the materials and tools of his work,
till such time at least as both these events can be brought about. A
weaver cannot apply himself entirely to his peculiar business, unless there is before-hand stored up somewhere, either in his own
possession, or in that of some other person, a stock sufficient to
maintain him, and to supply him with the materials and tools of
his work, till he has not only completed, but sold his web. This
accumulation must evidently be previous to his applying his industry for so long a time to such a peculiar business.
As the accumulation of stock must, in the nature of things, be
previous to the division of labour, so labour can be more and more
subdivided in proportion only as stock is previously more and
more accumulated. The quantity of materials which the same
number of people can work up, increases in a great proportion as
labour comes to be more and more subdivided; and as the operations of each workman are gradually reduced to a greater degree of
simplicity, a variety of new machines come to be invented for facilitating and abridging those operations. As the division of labour

HE GREAT COMMERCE of every civilized society is that car

ried on between the inhabitants of the town and those
of the country. It consists in the exchange of rude for

manufactured produce, either immediately, or by the intervention of money, or of some sort of paper which represents money.
The country supplies the town with the means of subsistence and
the materials of manufacture. The town repays this supply, by
sending back a part of the manufactured produce to the inhabitants of the country. The town, in which there neither is nor can be
any reproduction of substances, may very properly be said to gain
its whole wealth and subsistence from the country. We must not,
however, upon this account, imagine that the gain of the town is
the loss of the country. The gains of both are mutual and recipro-

goods with the produce of a much smaller quantity of their own
labour, than they must have employed had they attempted to prepare them themselves. The town affords a market for the surplus
produce of the country, or what is over and above the maintenance of the cultivators; and it is there that the inhabitants of the
country exchange it for something else which is in demand among
them. The greater the number and revenue of the inhabitants of
the town, the more extensive is the market which it affords to
those of the country; and the more extensive that market, it is
always the more advantageous to a great number. The corn which
grows within a mile of the town, sells there for the same price with
that which comes from twenty miles distance. But the price of the
latter must, generally, not only pay the expense of raising it and
bringing it to market, but afford, too, the ordinary profits of agriculture to the farmer. The proprietors and cultivators of the country, therefore, which lies in the neighbourhood of the town, over
and above the ordinary profits of agriculture, gain, in the price of
what they sell, the whole value of the carriage of the like produce
that is brought from more distant parts; and they save, besides,

interrupted the commerce between the towns and the country.
The towns were deserted, and the country was left uncultivated;
and the western provinces of Europe, which had enjoyed a considerable degree of opulence under the Roman empire, sunk into
the lowest state of poverty and barbarism. During the continuance of those confusions, the chiefs and principal leaders of those
nations acquired, or usurped to themselves, the greater part of the
lands of those countries. A great part of them was uncultivated;
but no part of them, whether cultivated or uncultivated, was left
without a proprietor. All of them were engrossed, and the greater
part by a few great proprietors.

HOW THE COMMERCE OF TOWNS
CONTRIBUTED TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE COUNTRY

shall now proceed to explain.

THE INCREASE AND RICHES of commercial and manufacturing towns
contributed to the improvement and cultivation of the countries
to which they belonged, in three different ways:
First, by affording a great and ready market for the rude produce of the country, they gave encouragement to its cultivation
and further improvement. This benefit was not even confined to
the countries in which they were situated, but extended more or
less to all those with which they had any dealings. To all of them
they afforded a market for some part either of their rude or manufactured produce, and, consequently, gave some encouragement
to the industry and improvement of all. Their own country, however, on account of its neighbourhood, necessarily derived the
greatest benefit from this market. Its rude produce being charged
with less carriage, the traders could pay the growers a better price
for it, and yet afford it as cheap to the consumers as that of more
distant countries.
Secondly, the wealth acquired by the inhabitants of cities was

of a statesman or legislator, proposes two distinct objects;

system of commerce, the other that of agriculture. I shall endeavour to explain both as fully and distinctly as I can, and shall begin
with the system of commerce. It is the modern system, and is best

The balance of produce and consumption may be constantly in

generally against it. A nation may import to a greater value than it
exports for half a century, perhaps, together; the gold and silver
which comes into it during all this time, may be all immediately
sent out of it; its circulating coin may gradually decay, different
sorts of paper money being substituted in its place, and even the
debts, too, which it contracts in the principal nations with whom
it deals, may be gradually increasing; and yet its real wealth, the
exchangeable value of the annual produce of its lands and labour,
may, during the same period, have been increasing in a much greater

nopoly of the home market, but desire likewise the most extensive
foreign sale for their goods. Their country has no jurisdiction in
foreign nations, and therefore can seldom procure them any monopoly there. They are generally obliged, therefore, to content themselves with petitioning for certain encouragements to exportation.
Of these encouragements, what are called drawbacks seem to be
the most reasonable. To allow the merchant to draw back upon
exportation, either the whole, or a part of whatever excise or inland duty is imposed upon domestic industry, can never occasion
the exportation of a greater quantity of goods than what would
have been exported had no duty been imposed. Such encouragements do not tend to turn towards any particular employment a
greater share of the capital of the country, than what would go to
that employment of its own accord, but only to hinder the duty
from driving away any part of that share to other employments.
They tend not to overturn that balance which naturally establishes itself among all the various employments of the society, but
to hinder it from being overturned by the duty. They tend not to

titioned for, and sometimes granted, to the produce of particular
branches of domestic industry. By means of them, our merchants
and manufacturers, it is pretended, will be enabled to sell their
goods as cheap or cheaper than their rivals in the foreign market.
A greater quantity, it is said, will thus be exported, and the balance
of trade consequently turned more in favour of our own country.
We cannot give our workmen a monopoly in the foreign, as we
have done in the home market. We cannot force foreigners to buy
their goods, as we have done our own countrymen. The next best
expedient, it has been thought, therefore, is to pay them for buying. It is in this manner that the mercantile system proposes to
enrich the whole country, and to put money into all our pockets,
by means of the balance of trade.
Bounties, it is allowed, ought to be given to those branches of
trade only which cannot be carried on without them. But every
branch of trade in which the merchant can sell his goods for a
price which replaces to him, with the ordinary profits of stock, the
whole capital employed in preparing and sending them to mar-

is obliged to sell them for less than it really cost him to send them to
market. The bounty is given in order to make up this loss, and to
encourage him to continue, or, perhaps, to begin a trade, of which
the expense is supposed to be greater than the returns, of which
every operation eats up a part of the capital employed in it, and
which is of such a nature, that if all other trades resembled it, there
would soon be no capital left in the country.
The trades, it is to be observed, which are carried on by means
of bounties, are the only ones which can be carried on between
two nations for any considerable time together, in such a manner
as that one of them shall alwayâs and regularly lose, or sell its goods
for less than it really cost to send them to market. But if the bounty
did not repay to the merchant what he would otherwise lose upon
the price of his goods, his own interest would soon oblige him to
employ his stock in another way, or to find out a trade in which
the price of the goods would replace to him, with the ordinary
profit, the capital employed in sending them to market. The effect

The colonies carry out with them a knowledge of agriculture
and of other useful arts, superior to what can grow up of its own

in their own country, of the system of laws which support it, and
of a regular administration of justice; and they naturally establish
something of the same kind in the new settlement. But among

fortune to fall under their government.
THOUGH THE ENCOURAGEMENT of exportation, and the discouragement of importation, are the two great engines by which the
mercantile system proposes to enrich every country, yet, with regard to some particular commodities, it seems to follow an opposite plan: to discourage exportation, and to encourage importation. Its ultimate object, however, it pretends, is always the same,
to enrich the country by an advantageous balance of trade. It discourages the exportation of the materials of manufacture, and of
the instruments of trade, in order to give our own workmen an
advantage, and to enable them to undersell those of other nations
in all foreign markets; and by restraining, in this manner, the exportation of a few commodities, of no great price, it proposes to
occasion a much greater and more valuable exportation of others.
It encourages the importation of the materials of manufacture, in
order that our own people may be enabled to work them up more
cheaply, and thereby prevent a greater and more valuable importation of the manufactured commodities. I do not observe, at least
in our statute book, any encouragement given to the importation

may frequently do much more than repay it to a great society.

necessarily supposes a certain expense; and this expense again necessarily requires a certain revenue to support it. In the following
book, therefore, I shall endeavour to explain, first, what are the
necessary expenses of the sovereign or commonwealth; and which
of those expenses ought to be defrayed by the general contribution of the whole society; and which of them, by that of some
particular part only, or of some particular members of the society:
secondly, what are the different methods in which the whole society may be made to contribute towards defraying the expenses
incumbent on the whole society; and what are the principal advantages and inconveniencies of each of those methods: and thirdly,

Of the Expense of Defence

T

HE FIRST DUTY of the sovereign, that of protecting the

society from the violence and invasion of other independent societies, can be performed only by means of a

military force. But the expense both of preparing this military
force in time of peace, and of employing it in time of war, is very
different in the different states of society, in the different periods
of improvement.

increase considerably the load of taxes in those two provinces. The
republican form of government seems to be the principal support
of the present grandeur of Holland. The owners of great capitals,
the great mercantile families, have generally either some direct
share, or some indirect influence, in the administration of that
government. For the sake of the respect and authority which they
derive from this situation, they are willing to live in a country
where their capital, if they employ it themselves, will bring them
less profit, and if they lend it to another, less interest; and where
the very moderate revenue which they can draw from it will purchase less of the necessaries and conveniencies of life than in any
other part of Europe. The residence of such wealthy people necessarily keeps alive, in spite of all disadvantages, a certain degree of
industry in the country. Any public calamity which should destroy the republican form of government, which should throw the

introduce, are altogether unknown; the person who possesses a
large revenue, I have endeavoured to show in the third book of
this Inquiry, can spend or enjoy that revenue in no other way than
by maintaining nearly as many people as it can maintain. A large
revenue may at all times be said to consist in the command of a
large quantity of the necessaries of life. In that rude state of things,
it is commonly paid in a large quantity of those necessaries, in the
materials of plain food and coarse clothing, in corn and cattle, in
wool and raw hides. When neither commerce nor manufactures
furnish any thing for which the owner can exchange the greater
part of those materials which are over and above his own consumption, he can do nothing with the surplus, but feed and clothe
nearly as many people as it will feed and clothe. A hospitality in
which there is no luxury, and a liberality in which there is no
ostentation, occasion, in this situation of things, the principal expenses of the rich and the great. But these I have likewise endeav-

though the hospitality of luxury, and the liberality of ostentation
have ruined many. Among our feudal ancestors, the long time
during which estates used to continue in the same family, sufficiently demonstrates the general disposition of people to live within
their income. Though the rustic hospitality, constantly exercised
by the great landholders, may not, to us in the present times, seem
consistent with that order which we are apt to consider as inseparably connected with good economy; yet we must certainly allow
them to have been at least so far frugal, as not commonly to have
spent their whole income. A part of their wool and raw hides, they
had generally an opportunity of selling for money. Some part of
this money, perhaps, they spent in purchasing the few objects of
vanity and luxury, with which the circumstances of the times could
furnish them; but some part of it they seem commonly to have
hoarded. They could not well, indeed, do any thing else but hoard
whatever money they saved. To trade, was disgraceful to a gentleman; and to lend money at interest, which at that time was con-
